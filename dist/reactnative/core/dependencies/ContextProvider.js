/***
 * Context provider is useful in cases where your view gets destroyed and you want to maintain scroll position when recyclerlistview is recreated e.g,
 * back navigation in android when previous fragments onDestroyView has already been called. Since recyclerlistview only renders visible items you
 * can instantly jump to any location.
 *
 * Use this interface and implement the given methods to preserve context.
